                            "feel the fear, and do it anyway"</br>
                            it's scary growing up but turning away from growth is like turning away from life.
                            imagine if a seed was afraid of becoming a great oak tree. maybe the ones that never germinate are the ones that were too afraid of the dark, never knowing that the sun was just right above the surface.
                            maybe the ones that did become trees accepted their fear, and fought through the dirt. it might be unprofessional to admit that i'm scared and sometimes i don't really know what i'm doing, but the cosmos so help me, 
                            i'm doing it. </br>

                            i recently watched a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/anil_seth_how_your_brain_hallucinates_your_conscious_reality/details" target="_blank">TED Talk</a> by neuroscientist, Anil Seth, 
                            wherein he poses the notion that our brains hallucinate our conscious reality. That is to say that our perception of the world is as much
                            sensing it as it is actively creating it, and possibly even more so. A simple but profound experiment he did during the talk really stuck with me. He played a distorted, incoherent
                            robotic sound, and then he played a recording of his voice saying a sentence. He then played the robotic voice again, and now, seconds later, the same sentence could be percieved within the distorted voice.
                            What is amazing here is that our brains learn very fast and are only able to give out their best guess at what's going on around the world based on previous experiences.
                            Perhaps that is why as humans, we are so fascinated with machine learning. If we are to one day truly build a self-aware AI, we need to first know how our own intelligence arises.
